    <string name="hatshepsut_history_text" translatable="false">"Hatshepsut was the daughter of Thutmose I and Great Royal Wife, Ahmose. Upon the death of her husband and half-brother Thutmose II, she had initially ruled as regent to her stepson, Thutmose III, who inherited the throne at the age of two. Several years into her regency, Hatshepsut assumed the position of pharaoh and adopted the full royal titulary, making her a co-ruler alongside Thutmose III. In order to establish herself in the Egyptian patriarchy, she took on traditionally male roles and was depicted as a male pharaoh, with physically masculine traits and traditionally male garb. Hatshepsut's reign was a period of great prosperity and general peace. One of the most prolific builders in Ancient Egypt, she oversaw large-scale construction projects such as the Karnak Temple Complex, the Red Chapel, the Speos Artemidos and most famously, the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari.  Hatshepsut died probably in Year 22 of Thutmose III.[9] Towards the end of the reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son Amenhotep II, an attempt was made to remove her from official accounts of Egyptian historiography. Her statues were destroyed, her monuments were defaced, and many of her achievements were ascribed to other pharaohs. Many modern historians attribute this to ritual and religious reasons, rather than personal hostility as previously thought. "</string>

    <string name="akhenaten_history">Akhenaten, originally named Amenhotep IV, reigned during the 18th Dynasty, approximately from 1353 to 1336 BCE. He is best known for radically transforming the religious landscape of ancient Egypt. Unlike his predecessors, who worshipped a pantheon of gods, Akhenaten established the worship of a single deity, Aten, the sun disk. This monotheistic shift was revolutionary and marked a significant departure from centuries of Egyptian tradition.</string>
    <string name="thuthmose_iii_history">Thutmose III, one of Egypt\'s greatest pharaohs, ruled during the 18th Dynasty, from approximately 1479 to 1425 BCE. He is often referred to as the \"Napoleon of Egypt\" due to his military prowess and numerous successful campaigns that expanded Egypt\'s empire to its greatest extent. As a young ruler, Thutmose III initially co-reigned with his stepmother, Hatshepsut, who served as his regent. Upon her death, Thutmose III took full control and embarked on a series of military campaigns that solidified his reputation as a formidable warrior king. His military expeditions extended Egypt\'s influence into the Near East and Nubia, securing vast amounts of wealth and resources.</string>
